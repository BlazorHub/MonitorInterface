# Monitor Interface website using .NET Framework, .NET Core 3.1, Blazor WebAssembly, and MatBlazor

This project is a working towards production website for the scheduling of monitoring and notifying of database issues. This project is using the most current preview of WebAssembly.

## General Notes

This web application was written in Visual Studio 2019. Blazor projects require Visual Studio 2019, the latest Visual Studio Code, or the command line to edit and compile.

## Blazor Notes

Microsoft's Blazor is a part of .NET Core, and WebAssembly is still in preview (not production ready) as of this Blazor version. Microsoft's projected release date for LTS, final version of Blazor WebAssembly is May 2020.

Performance is guaged on the client's system, as Blazor WebAssembly is hosted in the browser (client-side).

For more information on Blazor: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1

## MatBlazor Notes

I used the DatePicker from https://www.matblazor.com/

This website has many other material design components that can be used in Blazor apps.
